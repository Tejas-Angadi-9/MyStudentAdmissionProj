# MyStudentAdmissionProj
This is my first ever project on Java using OOPS concept. 
This project is regarding storing the engineering student's university details.

It takes the input for :

1. Number of students that needs to be enrolled.
2. First and last name
3. Date of birth
4. Phone number
5. Email id
6. Gender
7. Year (i.e -> 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th)
8. Branch (i.e -> EC, CS, EE, CV or ME)
9. Admission Cateogry (i.e -> CET/ COMED-k/ MANAGEMENT) 

After taking the inputs from the user. It assigns the USN (University Seat Number) based on the year and branch mentioned by the enroller. 
It also tells how much fees should be paid to CET/ COMED-K and Management students. (In this I have set the fees for CET/ COMED-K students as Rs. 86000 and for management students as Rs. 1,10,000). 
After this, it asks how much fees can the student pay at the mode of admission and then shows the remaining fees.
Once 1st student's details are stored it then asks for the input of the next student and the process continues until the end of the number of students that needs to be enrolled.
